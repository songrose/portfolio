  "about_text": [
    "I'm a recent graduate from BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology). I received my diploma in Computer Systems Technology which is a 2 year condensed diploma program. My studies consisted of Software Development, Computer Science, and Algorithms. Currently, I am seeking a job and open to opportunities.",
    " I have experience building mobile apps, websites, servers, and even IOT devices. I thoroughly enjoy solving problems and getting down to the nitty gritty while coding.",
    "One of the most magical, wonderful, brilliant, and favorite feelings in the world is when I enter my flow state. I always seek to enter the state of mind where I can program or do anything for hours and hours and forget about the world around me.",
    "On top of problem solving, I love building and designing things!  I do this not only through coding, but through exploring and creating new recipes, building games on Minecraft, and assembling Lego! I want to create things that bring a smile to peoples faces in addition to making life easier (through ways such as automating repetitive tasks, creating simple UIâ€™s that are easy to follow, etc).",
    "During my time at BCIT, I have attended various hackathons, and was involved in BCIT Coding 4 All. Hackathons were amazing because it allowed me to explore and create whatever I wanted outside of school (as well as increasing my sticker collection). My involvement in Coding 4 all was tutoring first semester programming students and doing presentations on web development and algorithms!"
